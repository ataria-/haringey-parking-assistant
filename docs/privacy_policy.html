  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

  <p>This privacy policy explains how the <strong>Haringey Multi-Day Parking</strong> Chrome extension handles your data.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Not affiliated:</strong> This extension is an independent tool and is <strong>not affiliated with or endorsed by Haringey Council</strong> or the permit website provider.
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> Your saved vehicles and preferences are stored locally in your browser.
    The extension communicates with:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>haringey.tarantopermits.com</strong> to help submit permit bookings you request</li>
      <li><strong>extensionpay.com</strong> to manage the free trial and subscription status</li>
    </ul>
    We do not sell your data or use it for advertising.
  </div>

  <h2>What data does this extension store?</h2>
  <p>The extension stores the following data locally in Chrome extension storage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Saved vehicles:</strong> Vehicle labels/names and registration numbers you choose to save</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your preferred booking start and end times (and similar settings)</li>
    <li><strong>Trial/subscription status:</strong> Information needed to remember whether premium is enabled (e.g., an entitlement flag or identifier)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This locally stored data is used only to provide the extension’s features. It is not uploaded to any server operated by the developer.</p>

  <h2>What data does this extension access on the permit website?</h2>
  <p>When you are on the Haringey permit booking pages, the extension reads information needed to assist with booking, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your selected parking zone and permit options shown on the page</li>
    <li>Your remaining voucher balance shown on the page</li>
    <li>Booking form fields required to submit bookings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This access is used to automate the booking workflow you initiate and to prevent unnecessary bookings.</p>

  <h2>What data does this extension send?</h2>
  <p><strong>1) Data sent to haringey.tarantopermits.com</strong></p>
  <p>The extension sends booking form data to <strong>haringey.tarantopermits.com</strong> to complete bookings you request. This is the same type of data you would enter manually on the site (e.g., vehicle registration, dates/times).</p>

  <p><strong>2) Data sent to extensionpay.com (subscriptions)</strong></p>
  <p>If you use the free trial or purchase a subscription, the extension communicates with <strong>extensionpay.com</strong> to verify trial/subscription status and to enable subscription management.</p>
  <p>The extension does <strong>not</strong> send your parking booking details (zones, dates, voucher balance, etc.) to ExtensionPay as part of subscription checks.</p>

  <h2>Payments and subscription processing</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions are processed by <strong>ExtensionPay</strong>, which uses <strong>Stripe</strong> for payment processing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you purchase a subscription, ExtensionPay collects your <strong>email address</strong> and stores payment information securely in Stripe.</li>
    <li>The developer does <strong>not</strong> receive your full payment card details.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See their policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://extensionpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExtensionPay</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions explained</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Saves your vehicles, preferences, and trial/subscription status locally</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to interact with the permit site tab while you are using it</li>

  </ul>
