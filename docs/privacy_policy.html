  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>UK Multi-Day Parking</strong> Chrome extension ("the extension")
    handles data.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Not affiliated:</strong> This extension is an independent tool and is <strong>not affiliated with or endorsed by
    any UK council</strong> or the permit website provider.
  </div>

  <div class="compatibility">
    <strong>Compatibility:</strong> This extension works exclusively with UK councils that use the Taranto parking permit system.
    If your council's parking website URL contains "tarantopermits.com" or "tarantoportal.com", this extension should work for you.
    Examples include Haringey, Southwark, Ealing, Hounslow, Tower Hamlets, Coventry, Wandsworth, and many others.
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Quick summary</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No login credentials stored:</strong> The extension never accesses or stores your username or password. You log in normally to your council's website.</li>
      <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Saved vehicle registrations and preferences are stored locally in Chrome extension storage on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Permit bookings:</strong> The extension interacts with your council's permit portal only to perform booking actions you initiate.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Subscription and trial status are handled via <code>extensionpay.com</code> (payments via Stripe).</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> The extension sends lightweight, anonymous usage analytics to help improve reliability. Analytics cannot currently be disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>No selling/ads:</strong> We do not sell data or use it for advertising.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Data stored locally (on your device)</h2>
  <p>The extension stores the following data locally in Chrome extension storage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vehicle registrations</strong> you save (and optional labels).</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences</strong> such as default booking times/settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial/subscription indicators</strong> (e.g., booking count and whether premium is enabled).</li>
    <li><strong>Installation identifier</strong> (a random ID used for analytics and to help prevent abuse of the free trial; it may sync with your Chrome profile depending on your browser settings).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The developer does not operate a server that stores your saved vehicles or permit bookings.
  </p>

  <h2>Data used on the permit website</h2>
  <p>
    When you use the official permit website, the extension reads page information needed to help you book permits,
    such as the zone/permit options shown on the page and values needed to complete the booking flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The extension does NOT store or access your login credentials.</strong> You log into your council's website normally using your own browser. The extension only interacts with the page after you are already logged in.
  </p>

  <h2>Where data is sent</h2>

  <h3>1) Permit booking websites: UK council portals</h3>
  <p>
    The extension sends booking form data (such as vehicle registration and the dates/times you choose) to
    your council's permit portal only to complete bookings you request.
    This is the same type of data you would submit manually on the site.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Subscriptions/trial: <code>extensionpay.com</code> (payments via Stripe)</h3>
  <p>
    The extension uses ExtensionPay to enable the free trial and paid subscription features (e.g., checking whether premium is enabled and opening the checkout/subscription management page).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you purchase a subscription, ExtensionPay/Stripe processes payment and may collect your <strong>email address</strong> and payment details.</li>
    <li>The developer does <strong>not</strong> receive your full payment card details.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

    <a href="https://extensionpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExtensionPay</a> and
    <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Privacy</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Anonymous analytics: Google Apps Script (<code>script.google.com</code>)</h3>
  <p>
    The extension sends limited, anonymous analytics to a Google Apps Script endpoint that writes to a private spreadsheet
    controlled by the developer. This helps improve reliability, diagnose issues, and reduce abuse of the free trial.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Analytics data sent includes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Event type</strong> (e.g., extension loaded, booking started/completed/cancelled, error).</li>
    <li><strong>Random installation ID</strong> (anonymous identifier).</li>
    <li><strong>Extension version</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Trial booking count</strong> (number of booking sessions used in the free trial).</li>
    <li><strong>Paid status</strong> (paid/unpaid boolean).</li>
    <li><strong>Council name</strong> (derived from the permit site subdomain, e.g., "haringey", "southwark").</li>
    <li><strong>Selected zone/location</strong> (as shown/selected on the permit site).</li>
    <li><strong>Booking metrics</strong> (e.g., number of days booked and vouchers used).</li>
    <li><strong>Error diagnostics</strong> (error message, and limited context such as the date being processed when the error occurred).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Analytics does NOT include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Vehicle registration numbers</li>
    <li>Voucher codes</li>
    <li>Login credentials</li>
    <li>Full page content or browsing history</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>IP address handling:</strong> When analytics data is sent to our Google Apps Script endpoint, a truncated, one-way hash of your IP address may be stored.
    This hashed identifier cannot be used to recover your actual IP address and is used solely to help detect patterns of free-trial abuse (e.g., the same person creating multiple accounts).
    We do not store or log your actual IP address.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Retention:</strong> Analytics logs are kept only as long as needed for debugging and product improvement and are
    typically retained for up to 180 days before being deleted.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions explained</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Store vehicles, preferences, trial/subscription indicators, and installation ID locally</li>
    <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Interact with the current permit site tab while you use it</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions:</strong> Allow the extension to run on supported UK council parking portals</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions (extensionpay.com):</strong> Allow the extension to communicate with ExtensionPay for subscription management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limited use</h2>
  <p>
    Data accessed from the permit website is used only to provide the extension's single purpose:
    helping you book and manage visitor parking permits more efficiently on UK council parking portals.
    Analytics data is used only to improve reliability, diagnose issues, and help prevent free-trial abuse.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices / deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete saved vehicles and preferences by clearing the extension's storage in Chrome extension settings or uninstalling the extension.</li>
    <li>You can cancel a subscription through the ExtensionPay subscription management flow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date.</p>

  <h2>Contact & Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    Questions about privacy? Suggestions for improvement? We welcome your feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> We value constructive feedback and may gift free Pro subscriptions to users who provide meaningful bug reports, feature suggestions, or help improve the extension.
