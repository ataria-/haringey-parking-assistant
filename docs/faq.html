  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Haringey Multi-Day Parking Extension — book visitor permits faster, with less hassle.</p>

  <div class="disclaimer">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This is an independent tool and is <strong>not made by or affiliated with Haringey Council</strong> (or the permit website provider). It simply helps automate the same steps you would do manually on the official portal.
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <h2>Why I built this</h2>
    <p>
      I live in Haringey and during a building project I had to book visitor permits constantly for over 7 months, for different cars.
      The portal only allows booking <strong>one day at a time</strong> — which meant repeating the same steps over and over.
      I lost quite a lot of time, made mistakes and got a couple of fines.
      So I decided to fix the problem myself and turn it into a simple tool others can benefit from too.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What does this extension do?</h3>
    <p>
      It helps you book multiple days of Haringey visitor parking permits in one flow instead of repeating the same booking process day-by-day.
      You select a date range, pick your vehicle, and the extension guides/automates the bookings.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Who is this useful for?</h3>
    <p>Anyone who regularly books visitor permits, especially:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Building works / trades:</strong> book a week (or more) without daily repetition.</li>
      <li><strong>Family visits:</strong> grandparents or relatives staying for several days.</li>
      <li><strong>Friends staying over:</strong> long weekends, holidays, or frequent visitors.</li>
      <li><strong>Busy households:</strong> reduce last-minute stress and avoid accidental gaps.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What’s the main use case?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Multi-day booking.</strong> The portal makes you repeat the same actions for each day.
      This extension reduces that friction, so it’s easier to stay compliant and avoid mistakes.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Does it help avoid unnecessary bookings?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. The extension can help you avoid booking permits when they aren’t needed (for example, outside restricted hours or on days that don’t require a permit).
      This saves time and can help avoid wasting vouchers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is it safe to use?</h3>
    <p>
      The extension only runs on the official Haringey permit website.
      It does <strong>not</strong> store your login details. Your saved vehicles and preferences are stored locally in your browser.
      Subscription access is managed by <strong>ExtensionPay</strong> (payment processing via <strong>Stripe</strong>).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Will it always work?</h3>
    <p>
      The extension depends on the permit website’s layout and behavior.
      If the council/provider updates the site, the extension may stop working temporarily.
      If that happens, please report it — I actively maintain the extension and aim to fix issues quickly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>
      You get <strong>3 free booking sessions</strong> to make sure it works for you and to see the benefits.
      After that, it’s <strong>£3/month</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:10px;">
      The fee helps cover development time and running costs, and is typically less than the cost of just a few hours of paid parking/permits —
      especially compared to the cost of a single fine.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What’s included in the free trial vs Pro?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Free trial:</strong> Multi-day booking (up to 3 booking sessions)<br>
      <strong>Pro:</strong> Unlimited multi-day bookings, save multiple vehicles, save favourite times, and smarter skipping of days/times that don’t require a permit
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
    <p>
      You can cancel anytime through the subscription/payment flow (Stripe via ExtensionPay).
      Your Pro access continues until the end of your billing period.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Something isn’t working — what do I do?</h3>
    <p>
      First, refresh the Haringey permit page and try again.
      If the problem persists, please get in touch and include:
      (1) what you were trying to do, (2) what happened, and (3) a screenshot if possible.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>I have an idea for a feature</h3>
    <p>
      Please share it! This extension exists because a real pain point needed fixing.
      Suggestions from other Haringey residents help make it better for everyone.
    </p>
