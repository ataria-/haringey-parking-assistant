  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="disclaimer">
    <strong>Important:</strong> This is an independent tool, not made by or affiliated with any council or the permit website provider. It's built to save time when booking visitor parking permits.
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What does this extension do?</h3>
    <p>It lets you book multiple days of visitor parking permits at once, instead of booking each day separately on your council's parking portal. Select a date range, pick your vehicle, and book all days with one click.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Which councils does this work with?</h3>
    <p>This extension works exclusively with UK councils that use the Taranto parking permit system. This includes councils like Haringey, Southwark, Ealing, Hounslow, Tower Hamlets, Coventry, Wandsworth, and many others. If your council's parking website URL contains "tarantopermits.com" or "tarantoportal.com", this extension should work for you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is this an official council tool?</h3>
    <p>No. This is an independent browser extension. It simply automates the same booking process you would do manually on your council's official parking website.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is it safe to use?</h3>
    <p>Yes. The extension only works on official council parking websites. It doesn't access or store your login credentials - you log in normally, and the extension simply helps you fill in the booking forms faster. Your saved vehicles and preferences are stored locally in your browser. The only data sent externally is anonymous usage analytics to help improve the extension.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Will it always work?</h3>
    <p>The extension depends on the Taranto booking system staying the same. If the system is updated significantly, the extension might stop working temporarily. We're committed to fixing any issues as quickly as possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Should I always use daily vouchers?</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Some councils offer weekly or multi-day voucher options that may be better value than buying 5+ individual daily vouchers. Before booking a long stay, check your council's available voucher types - you might save money with a weekly option. This extension currently works with hourly/daily vouchers; support for other voucher types is on our roadmap.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What about the "Skip days" feature?</h3>
    <p>The smart day skipping feature can automatically skip bank holidays and days that don't require permits for your zone. Currently, detailed zone data is available for Haringey. For other councils, the extension will skip bank holidays but cannot skip non-restricted days. We're adding more council zone data based on user requests.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>You get <strong>3 free booking sessions</strong> to try it out. After that, it's <strong>£3.90/month</strong> (about the cost of 3 daily visitor vouchers). Pro users also get extra features like saving multiple vehicles and favourite times.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What's included in Pro?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Free:</strong> Book multiple days at once (3 sessions)<br>
      <strong>Pro:</strong> Unlimited bookings, save multiple vehicles with custom names, save favourite booking hours, skip days that don't need permits
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
    <p>You can cancel anytime through the payment provider (Stripe via ExtensionPay). Your Pro access continues until the end of your billing period.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Something isn't working - what do I do?</h3>
    <p>Try refreshing the parking page. If the problem persists, please get in touch (see below). Include which council you're using, what you were trying to do, and any error messages you saw.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Roadmap</h2>
  <p>We're actively developing new features based on user feedback. Here's what's planned:</p>

  <div class="roadmap-item"><strong>More council zone data:</strong> Adding restriction hours for more councils so smart day skipping works everywhere</div>
  <div class="roadmap-item"><strong>Weekly voucher support:</strong> Support for weekly and other multi-day voucher types where available</div>
  <div class="roadmap-item"><strong>Voucher balance alerts:</strong> Get notified when your voucher balance is running low</div>
  <div class="roadmap-item"><strong>Booking history:</strong> View your past bookings made through the extension</div>
  <div class="roadmap-item"><strong>Multiple zones:</strong> Support for users who need permits in different zones</div>

  <p style="margin-top: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #6b7280;">Have a feature request? We prioritise based on user feedback - get in touch!</p>

  <div class="contact">
    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>Found a bug? Have a feature request? Want zone data added for your council?</p>

    <div class="feedback-highlight">
      <strong>We value your feedback!</strong> If you provide meaningful, constructive feedback that helps improve the extension, we may gift you a free Pro subscription as a thank you. Whether it's a bug report with detailed steps to reproduce, a well-thought-out feature suggestion, or zone data for your council - we appreciate users who help make this tool better for everyone.
